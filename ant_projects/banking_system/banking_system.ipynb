    "# Banking System Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tier 1: Core Transaction Management\n",
    "- Create an in-memory banking database system\n",
    "- Implement basic CRUD operations for accounts\n",
    "- Record and handle deposits and withdrawals\n",
    "- Implement transfer functionality between accounts\n",
    "- Ensure atomic operations (transfers must be accepted before processing)\n",
    "- Support transaction logging\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tier 2: Data Analytics & Metrics\n",
    "- Implement function that uses an efficient ranking algorithm to return top K accounts by: \n",
    "  - Total transaction volume (deposits + withdrawals)\n",
    "  - Total outgoing money\n",
    "- Track both incoming and outgoing transactions\n",
    "- Support data metrics and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tier 3: Advanced Transaction Features\n",
    "- Implement scheduled transactions system - can schedule a transaction at given time, and cancel it later \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tier 4: Account Management\n",
    "- Implement account merging functionality - merge two accounts while maintaining separate account histories\n",
    "- Preserve separate transaction histories when merging, maintain data integrity during merges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Follow-up Considerations\n",
    "- How would you scale this system?\n",
    "- How would you handle concurrent transactions?\n",
    "- How would you implement disaster recovery?\n",
    "- How would you optimize the ranking algorithm for large datasets?\n",
    "- How would you ensure data consistency with scheduled transactions?"
